A comprehensive Python library for quantitative finance, providing tools for financial analysis, backtesting, and portfolio optimization.

## Features

- **Backtesting Engine**: Test trading strategies with historical data
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Implement modern portfolio theory and risk management
- **Options Pricing**: Calculate option prices and Greeks using various models
- **Data Fetching**: Access financial data from various sources
- **Risk Management**: Implement risk metrics and management tools
- **Visualization**: Create insightful financial charts and graphs

## Installation

```bash
pip install pyfinquant
```

## Quick Start

```python
from pyfinquant import Backtest, Strategy
from pyfinquant.data_fetcher import YahooDataFetcher

# Fetch data
data = YahooDataFetcher.fetch_data(ticker="AAPL", period="1y")

# Create and run backtest
strategy = Strategy()  # Your custom strategy
backtest = Backtest(strategy=strategy, data=data)
results = backtest.run()
```

## Development Workflows

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. The workflows are organized as follows:

### 1. CI/CD Pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

The main CI/CD pipeline handles:
- Testing across Python versions (3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11)
- Coverage reporting
- Package building and deployment to PyPI

### 2. CodeQL Analysis (`.github/workflows/codeql.yml`)

Security analysis workflow that:
- Runs on push and pull requests
- Performs static code analysis
- Checks for security vulnerabilities
- Runs weekly scheduled scans

### 3. Pull Request Validation (`.github/workflows/pr.yml`)

Quality checks for pull requests:
- Linting with Ruff
- Type checking with mypy
- Security scanning with bandit
- Code formatting checks

### Workflow Triggers

- **Push to main**: Triggers full CI/CD pipeline
- **Pull Requests**: Triggers PR validation and CodeQL analysis
- **Weekly**: Scheduled security scans

### Required Secrets

The workflows require the following secrets to be set in the repository:
- `PYPI_API_TOKEN`: For publishing to PyPI
- `CODECOV_TOKEN`: For coverage reporting
